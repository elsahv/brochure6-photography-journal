            FOCUS: CTA, ABOUT, CONTACT... From here, we would discuss your
            website goals, needs, and ways to use your brand to provide value
          </p>
          <p>
            Some even found it overwhelming to think about- buying websites and
            maintaining an online presence.... all on top of everything else!

          <p>
            With your business needs in mind, I start designing a mockup layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to focus on interesting layouts, colorful pages, UX/ UI
            design, mobile and mobile optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finalizing the website design, I build the backbone of the
            site, using Javascript code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use my own library of dynamic UI components to build out different
            sections and pages. Code is kept up to date, enabling quick loading
            times

            evolves. You wont need to focus on building site, focus on own
